- **Compressor:** A multiband compressor that can control the dynamics of your tracks with precision and flexibility. It also has a vintage mode that can add character and color to your tracks.
- **Exciter:** A multiband saturator that can add harmonic distortion and richness to your tracks. It also has a blend control that can mix the dry and wet signals for parallel processing.

- **Track Assistant:** A feature that listens to your audio and automatically sets up an optimal starting point for your mix. You can choose from three modes: balanced, warm, or upfront.
